What is Docker ?
Docker solves one of the biggest problem is "It Runs on My machine" this problem is basically occurs because or maybe of One or more file is missing ,Software version mismatch, environment variables may be different.

Virtual Machines vs Docker ?


Architecture of Docker 
The Docker is based on the Client-server (Docker Engine)arch. and it communicate through the REST API.

Development Workflow of Docker :
Image File :
	A runtime Environment
	Contains Application files
	Third-Party Libraries
	Contains Environment Variabless

	Usage : Once we create a image file and then we push into a Docker hub (It like we are pushing our local git repo to the GitHub repo) and then we can pull it from the any machine to run the application.

Container :
	Container is nothing but the running process of the Image file.

To Build the Docker Image :
Creat a 'Dockerfile' file in the project folder 
and in that file add required code

use below command to build the docker image

-t = tag , docker-tutorial=image name , . = current directory
$ docker build -t docker-tutorial .

$ docker images
Output =`
REPOSITORY        TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
docker-tutorial   latest    074bfe12c146   3 minutes ago   153MB
`
to run the project
[node1] (local) root@192.168.0.13 ~/docker-tut/Docker-Tutorial
$ docker run docker-tutorial
