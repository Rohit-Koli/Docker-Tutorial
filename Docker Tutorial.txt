Architecture of Docker 
The Docker is based on the Client-server (Docker Engine)arch. and it communicate through the REST API.

Development Workflow of Docker :
Image File :
	A runtime Environment
	Contains Application files
	Third-Party Libraries
	Contains Environment Variabless

	Usage : Once we create a image file and then we push into a Docker hub (It like we are pushing our local git repo to the GitHub repo) and then we can pull it from the any machine to run the application.

Container :
	Container is nothing but the running process of the Image file.
